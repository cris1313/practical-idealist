2.how do we deal with stress.

setting goal is important
when we declare the goal, everything
around us become relative.
we co-create reality.

is not when you achieved goal you get happiness,
but having goal and the process of achieving it leads you to happiness

goals are means towards an end.
and the end are present experiences.

目标要和价值观契合

seize the day, do what you want.
